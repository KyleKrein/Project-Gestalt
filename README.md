# Project Gestalt
The Gestalt project is a mod that adds the final stage for each type of ascension:
The psionic path will lead your citizens to becoming pure energy, a higher form of life. Energetic creatures have their unique traits and phrases in dialogues with Unbidden and Prethoryn Scorge.
Biological ascension will help you to find the Gene of Perfection to make your species the most powerful race in the whole galaxy.
Synthetic ascension will lead you to becoming an empire with less individuality, uniting the minds of all residents for more effective work.

##Soul Eaters
Soul Eaters were added. They work simular to default empire, but they need souls of other species to feed. Hunger makes you fleets and armies stronger, but when you are fed, you have big bonuses to production and scientific research. They have an access the the Bleak Vortex - a part of the Shroud, where the Stranger lives...
Soul Eaters don't have access to both Synthethic and Psionic paths, but they have a special way to become energy creatures. Also, they have an option to follow the biological path of ascension. 

##Origins
